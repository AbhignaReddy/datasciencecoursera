Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==================================================================
The goal of the project is to take the accelerometer data available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and to do the following:
- Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Submissions:
1. CodeBook.md describing the variables,data and any other transformation used to achieve the goal
2. Readme.md to explain the project and how each submission is connected
3. run_analysis.R file containing the R code used for the project
4. Assignment.txt containing the final tidy dataset.
